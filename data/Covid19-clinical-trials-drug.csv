905,NCT04394117,Drug: Angiotensin Receptor Blockers,"Drug:Angiotensin Receptor Blockers:Angiotensin Receptor Blockers class have been in clinical use for more than 30 years for their cardiac and renal protective effects. ARBs mechanism of action is through selective inhibition of angiotensin II by competitive antagonism of the angiotensin receptor. ARBs displace angiotensin II from the angiotensin I receptor and produce their protective effects by reducing the downstream effects of angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction, aldosterone release, catecholamine release, arginine vasopressin release, water intake, and hypertrophic response. The virus causing COVID-19, the SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to the extracellular portion of ACE2 expressed on type II alveolar cells in the lungs which is followed by internalization of ACE2 before downregulating membrane ACE2 expression. Both these components appear to require angiotensin receptor Type 1 (AT1R), and ARBs, which block the actions of AT1R, would reduce the severity of COVID-19 and reduce the duration of symptoms.",Drug,Angiotensin Receptor Blockers,Angiotensin Receptor Blockers
